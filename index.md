# 🏅 Self-assessment

*Per ILO, choose 1 grade and remove the others.*

- ILO 1 (15%): 🟡 Sufficient (6)
- ILO 2 (15%): 🟡 Sufficient (6)
- ILO 3 (15%): 🔴 Poor (2)
- ILO 4 (40%): 🟢 Good (8)
- ILO 5 (15%): 🟡 Sufficient (6)

### My self-assessment grade is: 6.2

## Reflection on self-assessment grade
I underestimated how long it would take to complete ILO 4 and ILO 5.
I originally wanted to spend the last two days profiling and optimizing my final code, but while filling in my ILOs I found several flaws that still needed fixing. Because of this, I only had limited time left for profiling and no time for further optimization.

## How I plan to improve next block
I want to fix small issues immediately so they don’t build up into one big problem at the end. I also want to spend more consistent time on ILOs that give fewer points, instead of focusing almost entirely on one large ILO like I did with ILO 4 this block.

# 🪞 Block reflection

## My most significant achievements this block

*3 achievements you think are the most important, that you are most proud of*
- Combining my networking and proramming knowladge to create my own networking lib.
- A prediction system that replays the input from the mismatch forward.


## My most difficult challenges this block

*3 challenges you think were the hardest to cope with or overcome*
- Combining my networking and programming knowledge to create my own networking library.
- Implementing a client-side prediction system that replays inputs after a mismatch with the server state.
- Setting realistic and clear goals for the milesones on topics I'm not fermilliar with

## The most important lessons I learned

*3 lessons that you believe are the most meaningful for your future progress and success*
- Don't get lost on researching for hours. set a clear goal of what I want to know and a deadline.
- When working on somthing you know verry little about take an other look if the code really fits in overal architecture.
Somtimes i started implementing something only to realize later that it should be somewhere else. like the packet handeling on the server was in NetServer that should only receive, send, encrypt and decrypt.
- working with other people makes me more motivated to work on my project and show my progress.
